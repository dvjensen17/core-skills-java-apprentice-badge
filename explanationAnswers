Object Life Cycle
  1. Declared in a .java file.
  2. If static, can be used immediately with static properties.
  3. If not static, must be instantiated with the new keyword thus becomes an object and assigned to an object reference variable.
  4. As soon as an object loses all of it's reference variables, it becomes eligible for garbage collection which means the memory that it 
      once occupied is freed and returned to the heap to be repurposed.
