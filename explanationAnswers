Object Life Cycle
  1. Declared in a .java file.
  2. If static, can be used immediately with static properties.
  3. If not static, must be instantiated with the new keyword thus becomes an object and assigned to an object reference variable.
  4. As soon as an object loses all of it's reference variables, it becomes eligible for garbage collection which means the memory that it 
      once occupied is freed and returned to the heap to be repurposed.
      
Describe how the basic data types are represented in memory (boolean, int, long, String, array of ints, array of Objects, class with fields) 
  boolean: 1 bit; 0 = false, 1 = true
  char: 16 bits
  int:  32 bits; number from -32768 to 32767
  long:  64 bits; number from ‚Äê9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  String: an object which is a sequence of characters, immutable
  array of ints:  a container with a fixed number of ints
  array of Objects:  a container with a fixed number of Objects

Compare and contrast StringBuffer and StringBuilder and when to use each
  StringBuffer:  Thread safe (synchronized), less efficient
  StringBuilder, Not thread safe (non-synchronized), more efficient
  
ArrayList	
  Can contain duplicate elements
  Maintains insertion order
  non-synchronized
  Allows random access using index value
  Manipulation is slow (when removing elements)
LinkedList	
  Uses doubly-linked lists to store elements
  Can contain duplicate elements
  Maintains insertion order
  non-synchronized
  Fast because no manipulation required to add/remove elements
  Can be used as a list, stack or queue
HashMap	
  Stores key/value pairs
  Contains values based on a hash key
  Contains only unique elements
  May have one null key and multiple null values
  Maintains no order
HashSet	
  Stores objects
  Allows a null element
  Objects are stored using a hash mechanism
  Contains only unique elements
  Does not maintain order
TreeSet	
  Contains only unique elements
  null elements not allowed
  Fast access and retrieval
  Maintains ascending order
